## Lab: Text Translation from French to English
This repository contains the code for a lab conducted by MDSCL-2023 focused on text translation from French to English. The task involves using various Seq2Seq models to achieve accurate translations.

## Dataset
The lab utilizes the English-French bilingual corpus from the [Multi30k](https://github.com/multi30k/dataset) dataset. The necessary data files can be found in the "Data" directory of this repository.

## Seq2Seq Models
The lab code is organized in the notebook titled "Seq2Seq_models.ipynb." This notebook provides implementations of different Seq2Seq models for translation purposes. The models included are:

1. Uni-directional LSTM without attention
2. Uni-directional LSTM with attention
3. Bi-directional LSTM with attention

These models are designed to improve translation accuracy and showcase different approaches to solving the translation task.
